# TentsAndTreesPuzzle
The Tents and Trees Puzzle is a logic puzzle that involves placing tents in a grid filled with trees, following specific rules.
The objective of the puzzle is to place tents in the grid so that each tree has precisely one tent adjacent to it, either horizontally or vertically. 
The tents cannot be placed diagonally.
The puzzle usually comes in a grid with several trees marked on it. 
The objective is to place a tent next to each tree so that no tree is left without a tent and no two tents are placed adjacent.
